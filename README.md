Project One Repo - Due Feb 11th
Commuter App
Include the following:
1. Weather
2. News
3. Audio books recommendations
4. Traffic updates

If we want to add more things, we def can!

This is what we submitted to Ranjan

##Goal of website:
Commuter app with the following:
1. News
2. Weather
3. Traffic Patterns
4. Audibooks recommendations

5. Have current time

## Need APIs for items 1-5
- figure out what properties each object in each API has

## Search specifications
- User will be able to set their settings for area (based on area code or city name and state) for news and for weather so it always appears on their homepage
- search parameters for weather: city and state, and zipcode
- search parameters for news: they can type anything
- search for traffic patterns: city and state, and zipcode, or road name
- audiobooks: any topic

- set time display by time zone

##Var display on DOM
- show weather, traffic, news, and audio book searches all at once in different containers so that user is able to view it all at once


## News
- 4 top articles for user’s search (limit), show headline
- link to article
- API key
- AJAX CALL

## Weather

- today’s weather
- temperature in C or F
- Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy/Snow picture display
- search by: zipcode, city and state
- find out if the weather also displays the time, if so we can just use this and avoid adding an extra API

##Audiobooks
- show newbooks recommendation
- search: by topic

##Traffic THIS WILL BE A NICE ADDITION BUT NOT NECESSARY
- search by: highway, address destination (point to point destination)

##Time
- set by city 

For Saturday:
## Do we want each section to go into different pages on the website? or external links?
## Talk more about display and CSS 



With your group, answer each of the following questions:

- Who is target audience: People on the metro, carpooling, bus,  commuting to and from work
-  What is the problem that the product will address: News solves boredom issue, weather and traffic solves the issue of people on time or late to work
-  What is primary goal of product: Goal of product is to inform user all the things that could impact the commute to and from work
- Identify and prioritize essential user stories: Weather: want to know what weather is so I can pack a jacket News: I want to read about the news so I can get some entertainment from the content and be informed of the current global, national and local events. Audiobook: I want to get audio book recommendations, so that if I get stuck in traffic I can get some hands free entertainment
- Weather and News will be our MVP, bare minimum

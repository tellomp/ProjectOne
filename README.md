# ProjectOne
Project One Repo - Due Feb 11th

##Goal of website:
Commuter app with the following:
1. News
2. Weather
3. Traffic Patterns
4. Audibooks recommendations
5. Have current time 

## Need APIs for items 1-5
- figure out what properties each object in each API has 

## Search specifications
- User will be able to set their settings for area (based on area code or city name and state) for news and for weather so it always appears on their homepage 
- search parameters for weather: city and state, and zipcode
- search parameters for news: they can type anything
- search for traffic patterns: city and state, and zipcode, or road name
- audiobooks: any topic
- set time display by time zone 

##Var display on DOM
- show weather, traffic, news, and audio book searches all at once in different containers so that user is able to view it all at once 


## News
- 4 top articles for user's search (limit), show headline
- link to article
- API key
- AJAX CALL

## Weather
- today's weather 
- temperature in C or F
- Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy/Snow picture display
- search by: zipcode, city and state
- find out if the weather also displays the time, if so we can just use this and avoid adding an extra API 

##Audiobooks
- show newbooks recommendation
- search: by topic

##Traffic THIS WILL BE A NICE ADDITION BUT NOT NECESSARY
- search by: highway, address destination (point to point destination)

##Time
- set by city 

For Saturday:
## Do we want each section to go into different pages on the website? or external links?
## Talk more about display and CSS

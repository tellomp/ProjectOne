Project One Repo - Due Feb 11th

##Goal of website:
Commuter app with the following:
1. News
2. Weather
3. Traffic Patterns
4. Audibooks recommendations
5. Have current time

## Need APIs for items 1-5
- figure out what properties each object in each API has

## Search specifications
- User will be able to set their settings for area (based on area code or city name and state) for news and for weather so it always appears on their homepage
- search parameters for weather: city and state, and zipcode
- search parameters for news: they can type anything
- search for traffic patterns: city and state, and zipcode, or road name
- audiobooks: any topic
- set time display by time zone

##Var display on DOM
- show weather, traffic, news, and audio book searches all at once in different containers so that user is able to view it all at once


## News
- 4 top articles for user’s search (limit), show headline
- link to article
- API key
- AJAX CALL

## Weather
- today’s weather
- temperature in C or F
- Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy/Snow picture display
- search by: zipcode, city and state
- find out if the weather also displays the time, if so we can just use this and avoid adding an extra API

##Audiobooks
- show newbooks recommendation
- search: by topic

##Traffic THIS WILL BE A NICE ADDITION BUT NOT NECESSARY
- search by: highway, address destination (point to point destination)

##Time
- set by city

For Saturday:
## Do we want each section to go into different pages on the website? or external links?
## Talk more about display and CSS


Who is your target audience?

What is the problem that the product will address?

What is the primary goal of the product?

Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
As a user, I want to have the latest news, so that I can read it on the metro.
As a user, I want to know what the traffic is like on my commute, so that I can avoid traffic jams.

Remember, your MVP should be the absolute minimum product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives.
Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should not be part of the MVP.
